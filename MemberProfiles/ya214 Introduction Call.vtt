WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.245 --> 00:00:05.255
Hopefully it's okay.

2
00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:06.615
Yusef, we're, we're recording.

3
00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:11.535
We've actually recorded since 2021,

4
00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:14.735
we've recorded 5,000 hours in Vimeo of meetings.

5
00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:19.945
Oh. Uh, before that we did a lot of Zoom

6
00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.385
and Uber conference,

7
00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:25.555
and we use Microsoft Stream like streams.

8
00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:26.835
I don't you, Microsoft Streams.

9
00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.715
That's like a, that's integrated with the Microsoft teams.

10
00:00:30.135 --> 00:00:33.355
Mm-Hmm. Lot of content, lot of amazing people.

11
00:00:33.935 --> 00:00:36.355
Um, usually we, like,

12
00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.155
we just meet people like Yassen Cannan.

13
00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.715
We just like, we just, we go direct to them

14
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:43.035
and be like, what are you working on?

15
00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.435
And let us help you incubate it. You know?

16
00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:51.115
Um, yesin Canan is not as in the investment MedTech space.

17
00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:55.715
He's more in what we call the, um, uh, in order

18
00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:56.995
to be a member of your medical, you actually have

19
00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:00.675
to do five hours a month on average of education,

20
00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:01.955
research, or compassionate care.

21
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:06.195
Uh, that's based off of the founders of, uh, some

22
00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:07.235
of the founding team

23
00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:09.915
of Green Medical were from Phillips Exit Academy.

24
00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:11.875
That's where I went. And that's

25
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.675
where we overlapped about Brighter Horizons.

26
00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.195
Right. I think you were at Brighter Horizons then. Yeah.

27
00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:21.995
And then, um, you know, I've always had this passion to kind

28
00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:24.715
of impart the knowledge that I learned at Exeter to,

29
00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:25.875
you know, youth like you.

30
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:27.915
And that's where we met. How old were you when we met?

31
00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:32.285
Uh, I think I was 12 or 13.

32
00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:34.285
Oh my gosh. Oh, wow.

33
00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:39.045
That's, was that younger than you Isama, right? Yeah. Yeah.

34
00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:40.765
Yeah. That's crazy.

35
00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:44.965
You were mentoring a radiologist at that young of an age?

36
00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.565
I think so, yeah. 'cause this is back when I was,

37
00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:48.925
uh, assuming I would go down,

38
00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:50.005
It would've been 2014.

39
00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:52.405
So How old are you? It is 2014. It

40
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:53.405
Would've been 14.

41
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:55.725
Yeah. Yeah. So, so

42
00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:58.165
behind me is our senior creative advisor.

43
00:01:58.185 --> 00:01:59.885
That's Princeton University campus.

44
00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:02.645
Osama and I run meetings there.

45
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.925
Uh, I'm in the basement of my home

46
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:06.725
where we have a studio for Green Medical.

47
00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:10.005
Uh, we're just, um, you know, 10,

48
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.645
15 minutes from Princeton University.

49
00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.765
I have three children. I have a son,

50
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:16.485
ninth grade Princeton High School.

51
00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:18.925
I have a daughter who's in fifth grade.

52
00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.045
And I have a son that's, um, um, 1-year-old.

53
00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.325
Um, I, I am the co-founder.

54
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.045
My father was the other co-founder.

55
00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:31.485
Uh, he passed away Rahm Allah in the past, uh,

56
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.925
just like six months ago, less than six months ago.

57
00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:38.325
He was a physician. He was the best example of what those

58
00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:42.245
minority physicians were that came from India or abroad.

59
00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:46.205
And really, like, they had a successful practice.

60
00:02:46.275 --> 00:02:48.285
They ate, they earned good income.

61
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:52.325
They had complete control of their schedule and their data.

62
00:02:52.835 --> 00:02:54.285
They actually have their own data.

63
00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:57.085
Unlike now, you know, everything is bought out.

64
00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.525
My father was the last practice.

65
00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:01.725
I mean, he, he was probably the longest

66
00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:05.205
independent OB GYN in Western North Carolina.

67
00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:08.245
There probably no one did over 40 years independent.

68
00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.565
So, you know, the purpose of today's call is

69
00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:13.005
what we call a biopsychosocial

70
00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:14.685
to kind of get to know who you are.

71
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:17.365
I personally would like to offer you an

72
00:03:17.365 --> 00:03:18.485
internship opportunity.

73
00:03:19.145 --> 00:03:20.365
I'm sure you're looking for a job.

74
00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:22.165
Everyone's looking for a paid position.

75
00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:24.005
But what we do is we say, look,

76
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.605
do education research or compassionate care.

77
00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:29.805
Be on a podcast, be on, uh, a webinar.

78
00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:32.965
Help us create content about how

79
00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:34.965
to be an entrepreneur in med tech.

80
00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:38.725
But with the following intelligences in mind,

81
00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:41.685
clinical intelligence, business intelligence,

82
00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.605
creative intelligence, who is actually Dr.

83
00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:46.445
Ali Hussein is our senior creative advisor.

84
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:48.765
And then spiritual intelligence.

85
00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.685
We have incorporated the spiritual model

86
00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:52.405
into our business plans.

87
00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:55.605
Now, that can be tricky 'cause we never actually,

88
00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.005
we don't pay spiritual people.

89
00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:02.005
We, we, we just, if they ask for a favor, we help them.

90
00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.885
And then they, if they, if we need to,

91
00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:06.205
if we need help, they help us.

92
00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:08.205
And we work directly with the Office

93
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:12.165
of Spiritual Life at Princeton University, U Penn, Rutgers,

94
00:04:12.865 --> 00:04:14.085
um, VCU.

95
00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:17.605
Uh, we've recently started connections with, uh, NYU.

96
00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:22.095
Um, and, you know, at the end of the day, my job

97
00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:25.495
as the CEO is to just keep the network alive

98
00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:27.895
because we're still semial mode.

99
00:04:28.435 --> 00:04:31.145
For 10 years we've been growing this network.

100
00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.385
We have about 50 senior tech advisors.

101
00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:39.125
We have about 300 physicians, senior medical advisors, Dr.

102
00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:41.925
Ya. Nan has never been the type to kind

103
00:04:41.925 --> 00:04:43.445
of get into any of the business side.

104
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:46.045
He just does things. Bil Law, he helps.

105
00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:47.965
He's that kind of person. So

106
00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:50.685
whenever we, we have a student that needs mentoring

107
00:04:51.115 --> 00:04:53.365
that fits his profile, we connect him.

108
00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.125
And he's done that in the past. Mm-Hmm.

109
00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:56.685
But he's, he's one of 300

110
00:04:57.065 --> 00:05:00.965
and we've kept, uh, a score on all 305.

111
00:05:01.035 --> 00:05:03.645
It's, it's essentially 300 physicians,

112
00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:05.445
about 50 tech advisors,

113
00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.085
and then the rest of the a hundred, uh,

114
00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:10.085
or like senior creative advisors,

115
00:05:10.085 --> 00:05:11.565
policy advisors, legal advisors.

116
00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:15.525
So if you have a bright idea today, keep it, don't share it

117
00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:16.885
because it's being recorded.

118
00:05:17.345 --> 00:05:19.285
Mm-Hmm. We are the one-stop shop.

119
00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:23.205
We're trying to be like a Y Combinator one day. Mm-Hmm.

120
00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:24.325
But right now, we're coming out

121
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:25.685
with our app in the next month.

122
00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:29.845
And the app will give opportunities for people like you

123
00:05:30.345 --> 00:05:32.125
to get access to these people.

124
00:05:32.305 --> 00:05:33.805
But we've changed the model.

125
00:05:34.585 --> 00:05:37.765
No one has to pay to be in the network.

126
00:05:38.245 --> 00:05:41.805
Everyone usually has to know someone or, or have money.

127
00:05:42.355 --> 00:05:44.925
What we've done is we've created something called a Green

128
00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:47.765
Value Unit, where we monitor your education, research

129
00:05:47.765 --> 00:05:49.565
and compassionate care, those five hours a month

130
00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:51.645
of non cbi not for self helping.

131
00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:54.765
And we actually, we actually count that as currency.

132
00:05:55.705 --> 00:05:58.925
And we then use that currency to offset the cost

133
00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.205
for meetings with entrepreneurs in the network, per se.

134
00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.045
Um, it's,

135
00:06:04.115 --> 00:06:07.845
it's a little bit dow like decentralized autonomous

136
00:06:07.845 --> 00:06:10.445
organizations with the goal of having an NFT,

137
00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:12.165
but we're not there yet, but, right,

138
00:06:12.165 --> 00:06:13.165
Right. I about that. That

139
00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:13.805
was interesting.

140
00:06:14.515 --> 00:06:17.005
Yeah. So, so that's my spiel.

141
00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.925
I'm looking forward to off the record, calling you

142
00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.205
after I listen to the audio and telling you what I think.

143
00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:24.085
But Osama's gonna take it from here.

144
00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:25.685
And I want to thank you for making time.

145
00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.045
I'm, I'm excited about this opportunity to get to know you

146
00:06:28.045 --> 00:06:31.505
because Dallas is a huge hotspot for us.

147
00:06:31.605 --> 00:06:34.305
So I'll let Osama go into detail about that. All right.

148
00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:35.955
Appreciate it.

149
00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:42.745
You said my parents live in Plano.

150
00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:44.985
They have a restaurant over there. How far do you

151
00:06:44.985 --> 00:06:46.025
live? Where in Dallas are you?

152
00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.425
I'm in Plano right now. Tell me where and, uh,

153
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.125
Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's, so,

154
00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.025
I'm Pakistani.

155
00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:53.265
It's a Pakistan place called Dallas Kabob House.

156
00:06:53.535 --> 00:06:58.305
It's like, uh, it's like Coit and Spring Creek.

157
00:06:58.825 --> 00:06:59.825
I think

158
00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:02.425
I live on Spring Creek, so that's very convenient.

159
00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:04.945
How far is Preston

160
00:07:05.495 --> 00:07:06.495
From? I've

161
00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:07.425
actually seen a few times.

162
00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:10.645
It's like in a little strip on the end of the strip,

163
00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:12.845
And there's a lot of other, like this

164
00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:14.085
or out of restaurants, right.

165
00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:15.365
There's some, there's like,

166
00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:17.565
I think an Indo Park grocery store over there.

167
00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:20.805
There's a CVS at the intersection

168
00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:22.725
there. So yeah. That's what,

169
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.965
Or are you in, uh, he said you're based out of

170
00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:27.535
I'm in Chicago. Chicago.

171
00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:31.115
So my parents moved there about five years ago.

172
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:35.995
But I've, uh, I grew up in Wichita, Kansas, so that's

173
00:07:35.995 --> 00:07:39.635
where I met Soha when I was like, um, in early high school.

174
00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:42.875
Okay. Um, and him

175
00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:44.835
and I have kept in touch since then as well.

176
00:07:44.835 --> 00:07:47.435
I went to school, uh, from my undergrad in North Carolina.

177
00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:51.315
Um, and, uh, kept up with him too,

178
00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.395
'cause his, uh, parents had a house in

179
00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:54.675
Charlotte, so I was near there too.

180
00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:56.835
So I've known say for a while as well.

181
00:07:57.055 --> 00:07:58.755
Uh, I've been working with your medical for about

182
00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.185
a little over three years now.

183
00:08:01.565 --> 00:08:04.785
Um, and so like getting to

184
00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:07.625
know people a bit better, uh, with onboarding.

185
00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:09.665
So going over like the biopsychosocial.

186
00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:14.185
So what that, the purpose of going over that is, um,

187
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:17.395
some places have an application, things like that.

188
00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:19.355
This, that's the application of sorts.

189
00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:21.635
It's, it's like a profile on each individual person

190
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.915
that's a little bit more in depth than I think what most

191
00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:25.995
of the places would ever do.

192
00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:31.905
And it covers, um, the bio part, which is the,

193
00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:34.705
like what covers your biological needs, you know,

194
00:08:34.705 --> 00:08:37.065
what helps you pay the rent, pay for food, things like that.

195
00:08:37.165 --> 00:08:40.665
And so typically that's what your day job is

196
00:08:40.725 --> 00:08:42.865
and that's what, or your status as a student.

197
00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:44.985
So your currently

198
00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:48.725
what year in grad school, is that

199
00:08:48.725 --> 00:08:49.925
what your full-time gig is?

200
00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:52.255
I just finished the first semester

201
00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:55.055
of my master's in computer Science.

202
00:08:56.055 --> 00:08:59.015
How's that going? It's interesting.

203
00:08:59.315 --> 00:09:01.975
Uh, a lot of people go

204
00:09:02.395 --> 00:09:06.055
and join computer science to become software developers,

205
00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:08.695
machine learning engineers, AI architects,

206
00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:12.495
but it's really computer science, the science of a computer.

207
00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:18.185
So it's very distant from the actual

208
00:09:18.225 --> 00:09:20.865
hands-on work you're gonna be doing at least initially.

209
00:09:21.325 --> 00:09:23.745
So for example, the last course I took was all about,

210
00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.105
uh, computer architecture.

211
00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:28.915
So it went all the way down to a language called assembly.

212
00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:31.135
So you're the, you're familiar with assembly

213
00:09:31.835 --> 00:09:33.575
and we're specific, like,

214
00:09:33.865 --> 00:09:35.815
we're calling register by register.

215
00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.375
Very, very detailed instructions.

216
00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:38.975
When in reality, the majority

217
00:09:38.975 --> 00:09:40.815
of us are gonna be working off of Python.

218
00:09:41.275 --> 00:09:44.735
And not only Python, but like libraries, DUIs, um,

219
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.375
off the cloud where we're very,

220
00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:47.895
very far from the computer itself.

221
00:09:48.595 --> 00:09:53.095
So it was, I would call it, uh, an unexpected surprise.

222
00:09:53.195 --> 00:09:55.095
But at the end of the day, it was very interesting.

223
00:09:55.355 --> 00:09:58.815
Um, 'cause for example, we learned, like for a lot

224
00:09:58.815 --> 00:10:00.455
of cloud engineers, they're working off a

225
00:10:00.455 --> 00:10:01.775
magic computer in the sky.

226
00:10:01.925 --> 00:10:03.415
They don't know exactly what's going on.

227
00:10:03.515 --> 00:10:05.895
And we learned about virtualization, we learned about, uh,

228
00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:07.495
resource allocation, we learned about the

229
00:10:07.495 --> 00:10:08.855
commands after go back and forth.

230
00:10:09.475 --> 00:10:12.575
So it kind of demystified, if you would say, uh, a lot

231
00:10:12.575 --> 00:10:14.135
of the different things that computers do.

232
00:10:15.525 --> 00:10:18.515
Yep. And as far as like

233
00:10:19.575 --> 00:10:22.105
your long-term goals, right?

234
00:10:22.235 --> 00:10:23.345
Where do you see yourself,

235
00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:27.105
let's say you get your master's degree in Shaah in 2025.

236
00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:29.345
What's, what's your ideal

237
00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:32.885
place to be career-wise?

238
00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:35.405
Okay, so these, my,

239
00:10:35.505 --> 00:10:38.525
my career goals are tied very heavily into my personal life.

240
00:10:38.945 --> 00:10:41.805
Um, yeah, they're not other, I'm married at ela.

241
00:10:42.545 --> 00:10:45.605
Um, so one of my plans is to start a family soon in Shaah.

242
00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:48.875
So I would have to begin

243
00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:51.955
with the quote unquote stable job slash profession.

244
00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:54.755
Um, and I would actually line this up

245
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:57.395
with my actual career goal of entering the field

246
00:10:57.455 --> 00:10:59.075
as an employee instead of entrepreneur.

247
00:10:59.615 --> 00:11:02.675
Um, especially with the field of ai, there's

248
00:11:03.185 --> 00:11:04.355
more to learn than there isn't.

249
00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:06.595
And that's gonna be like continuously to grow.

250
00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:10.715
Like it's, it's a ever-growing, uh, horizon. Yeah.

251
00:11:10.715 --> 00:11:13.675
And the whole goal is to work for long enough

252
00:11:13.685 --> 00:11:15.275
until you find a frontier

253
00:11:15.775 --> 00:11:18.435
or you find a spot to work that you can excel in

254
00:11:19.015 --> 00:11:21.595
and to one day, you know, say goodbyes

255
00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:22.635
and start something of your own.

256
00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:27.675
Um, so the short-term goal, I would say is to enter a

257
00:11:29.435 --> 00:11:33.025
quote unquote cutting edge, um, use case of AI

258
00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:34.225
or machine learning technology

259
00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:36.985
or cloud engineering, one of the two,

260
00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:39.105
those are my quote unquote specialties.

261
00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:42.745
Um, after that, I would hope to move on from entry level

262
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:46.865
to some form of a senior position where I learn, okay,

263
00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:48.745
this is an individual contributor.

264
00:11:49.615 --> 00:11:51.025
What does it take to run a team?

265
00:11:51.025 --> 00:11:53.885
Because in the future, if you wanna make a real business,

266
00:11:53.955 --> 00:11:55.925
it's not based off of individual contribution,

267
00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.965
it's based off of the collaboration between individuals.

268
00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:02.085
So that one plus one becomes three instead of two.

269
00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:05.405
So I wanna hopefully get to a position where I'm a senior

270
00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:08.885
or a manager or a product level manager so I can comprehend

271
00:12:09.845 --> 00:12:11.575
this is the individual input.

272
00:12:11.915 --> 00:12:14.335
How do you combine these to make an actual product?

273
00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.745
And then hopefully when you're bumping

274
00:12:16.745 --> 00:12:19.345
around people in corporate for so long, you learn about,

275
00:12:19.345 --> 00:12:20.785
okay, how are people deploying these?

276
00:12:20.845 --> 00:12:22.225
How are people selling this? How are

277
00:12:22.225 --> 00:12:23.665
people, um, growing this?

278
00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:26.465
What is the next page? How do people write the next page?

279
00:12:26.525 --> 00:12:27.745
And so on. Um,

280
00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:31.895
have been told away from joining corporate right off the

281
00:12:31.895 --> 00:12:33.015
bat and making your own startup.

282
00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:36.895
But at the end of the day, if it's your very first startup,

283
00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:39.215
that can be done in parallel with a full-time position.

284
00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:42.655
Um, because you're, I learned that the first business,

285
00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:43.895
you're learning how to start a business.

286
00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:44.975
The second business, you're learning how

287
00:12:44.975 --> 00:12:46.535
to sell, uh, your product.

288
00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:48.735
And the third business, you're learning how to keep

289
00:12:48.735 --> 00:12:50.495
that business running without you.

290
00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:52.175
So it's like the first one. Yeah.

291
00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:53.935
Go and learn how you start up a product,

292
00:12:54.435 --> 00:12:56.735
how you develop something from the front to the end.

293
00:12:57.115 --> 00:12:58.655
And then a lot of people hit this wall.

294
00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:01.335
I didn't ask to see who's gonna buy this.

295
00:13:01.575 --> 00:13:03.895
I didn't even tap to see if there's a market. Okay.

296
00:13:03.895 --> 00:13:04.935
So back to the drawing board.

297
00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:06.255
And then this time you have something

298
00:13:06.255 --> 00:13:09.335
that may be a little bit more profitable, less friction,

299
00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:11.015
more usable to other people.

300
00:13:11.045 --> 00:13:13.135
Then you learn keywords like impact and,

301
00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:16.615
and, uh, customer, customer, uh, preferences.

302
00:13:17.445 --> 00:13:18.905
And then because you've already learned

303
00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:22.025
to get a product done from A to Z, maybe you've learned,

304
00:13:22.025 --> 00:13:24.625
okay, I'm gonna allocate or subcontract this part.

305
00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:26.305
I'm gonna have this outsourced.

306
00:13:26.365 --> 00:13:28.025
I'm gonna do this a little bit more efficiently.

307
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.585
And then let, maybe that will work.

308
00:13:29.605 --> 00:13:30.865
Or maybe you're gonna fail again

309
00:13:30.865 --> 00:13:32.145
and start again from the drawing board.

310
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.905
And now you have this and this and this, and this and this.

311
00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.345
And the key here, I think is to start young.

312
00:13:36.845 --> 00:13:40.225
So I would like, hopefully inshallah to join a position

313
00:13:40.335 --> 00:13:43.145
that is in AI slash machine learning.

314
00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:45.465
So there's a little bit of overlap when I'm

315
00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:46.585
learning how to build products.

316
00:13:46.845 --> 00:13:49.065
So that first phase of, you know, entrepreneurship

317
00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:53.345
as a technical individual will be heavily overlapped

318
00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:56.905
with building ai, being a developer, um, learning how

319
00:13:56.905 --> 00:13:59.705
to turn a problem into a product, if that makes sense.

320
00:14:01.805 --> 00:14:04.645
I hope I didn't just big, uh, big words at you

321
00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:07.245
and it actually sounds like a, a well thought out plan.

322
00:14:08.165 --> 00:14:09.185
No, no, no, I get it. I mean,

323
00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:10.665
I've been doing this stuff for the last three years.

324
00:14:10.785 --> 00:14:12.465
I mean, most of my professional experience has been

325
00:14:12.465 --> 00:14:14.385
with startups or late state startups,

326
00:14:14.405 --> 00:14:18.585
and to some degree more of corporate environment as well.

327
00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.505
In most, most

328
00:14:20.525 --> 00:14:23.265
of my other professional experience is in higher education,

329
00:14:23.565 --> 00:14:28.265
uh, being on a campus or in, um, higher ed technology.

330
00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:31.585
And so, um, a lot of that is, you know,

331
00:14:31.685 --> 00:14:33.225
has scaled in the last few years.

332
00:14:33.285 --> 00:14:34.705
And so it is been interesting seeing

333
00:14:34.705 --> 00:14:35.865
how of how things develop.

334
00:14:35.865 --> 00:14:38.465
And with Green Medical, I mean, I've seen businesses, people

335
00:14:38.465 --> 00:14:42.665
with ideas that are from infancy to all sorts

336
00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:44.145
of points in the process.

337
00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:49.305
Um, and I myself, like typically hold in, like I do a lot

338
00:14:49.305 --> 00:14:51.765
of the operations with premedical, uh, okay.

339
00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:53.725
Administer a lot of what we do.

340
00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:57.585
And with that, like, I've picked up things like, you know,

341
00:14:57.585 --> 00:15:00.825
project management, product management skills that,

342
00:15:00.925 --> 00:15:03.745
you know, obviously not in like a true setting,

343
00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:05.665
but, um, skills that

344
00:15:05.665 --> 00:15:07.305
nonetheless kind of come up a lot of time.

345
00:15:07.385 --> 00:15:09.945
I have like a Scrum Master's certification where I took,

346
00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:12.505
you know, training to understand what that process is like.

347
00:15:12.605 --> 00:15:14.105
And so I was studying a little bit

348
00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:18.185
for like a project management, uh, for p and p as well.

349
00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:23.025
Um, but, um, no, no, it all makes sense to me.

350
00:15:23.045 --> 00:15:26.465
And it's good that you have like a pretty good idea of what

351
00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:28.145
specific steps that you need to take

352
00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:29.385
over the next few years.

353
00:15:29.665 --> 00:15:30.705
'cause obviously you're in that place,

354
00:15:30.705 --> 00:15:32.105
you gotta think about it, you gotta think about family

355
00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:33.745
and and whatnot as well.

356
00:15:33.885 --> 00:15:36.865
So, so what I'm now curious about is

357
00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:38.305
where does Green Medical come in for you?

358
00:15:38.765 --> 00:15:40.625
Um, yeah,

359
00:15:41.335 --> 00:15:44.385
There's, uh, several things, um, I could gain from

360
00:15:44.525 --> 00:15:45.785
and contribute to Green.

361
00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:49.105
Um, the first off being, uh, like you've mentioned,

362
00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:52.105
like an internship slash first position, there's a lot

363
00:15:52.105 --> 00:15:54.105
of individuals out there who I'm guessing came

364
00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:57.745
to you in need of talent and carefully vetted talent.

365
00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:00.505
You could say, um, I'm looking

366
00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:02.545
for an individual who's also looking for a vetted,

367
00:16:03.005 --> 00:16:07.995
and, um, I don't want to, but, you know, toot my own horn,

368
00:16:07.995 --> 00:16:09.715
but higher level, higher caliber talent,

369
00:16:10.025 --> 00:16:13.625
because I like the type of employer

370
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:15.865
that throws their employee into a problem

371
00:16:16.605 --> 00:16:18.475
while teaching them on the way, if that makes sense.

372
00:16:19.035 --> 00:16:22.865
A lot of places, entry level means put on hold

373
00:16:24.445 --> 00:16:27.675
until eventually a new project lands on your lap.

374
00:16:27.975 --> 00:16:29.875
Versus, like you said, in the startup world,

375
00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:32.035
they need people to do things.

376
00:16:32.225 --> 00:16:33.515
They need people to solve problems.

377
00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:35.315
Let's not go through training, if that makes sense.

378
00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:38.155
So I know there's a lot of individuals who are in that,

379
00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:41.555
you know, 40 employee to, you know, 60 employee range

380
00:16:41.555 --> 00:16:45.275
or even the 20 employee range that are looking for people

381
00:16:45.825 --> 00:16:48.715
that they can, you know, co work with essentially.

382
00:16:49.415 --> 00:16:52.635
Um, the second front is I have my own ideas, uh,

383
00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:54.235
different businesses I wanna start.

384
00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:57.615
Some of them are past prototype stage, um,

385
00:16:57.835 --> 00:17:01.335
and there are individuals who can guide me on the process of

386
00:17:02.045 --> 00:17:04.855
turning this idea into actual,

387
00:17:05.635 --> 00:17:07.765
uh, progress, if that makes sense.

388
00:17:07.785 --> 00:17:09.845
And results, uh, hopefully, I'm sure there's a lot

389
00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:12.605
of entrepreneurs who are in the tech and medical field,

390
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:14.805
and using my knowledge, they could kind

391
00:17:14.805 --> 00:17:19.365
of shape me from a student into a action manner,

392
00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:22.165
someone who can accomplish things, if that makes sense.

393
00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:24.885
I learned a while ago that, um,

394
00:17:25.305 --> 00:17:27.965
if you ask someone about a problem they faced,

395
00:17:28.545 --> 00:17:29.765
you won't have to face that problem

396
00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:31.365
because you'll know how to go through it.

397
00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:32.925
Or when you do face it, you won't be lost.

398
00:17:33.505 --> 00:17:36.445
Um, and I kind of got addicted to using that

399
00:17:36.445 --> 00:17:39.565
to like fast forward myself through different navigational,

400
00:17:39.565 --> 00:17:42.765
like tribulations or, or difficulties I face.

401
00:17:42.825 --> 00:17:45.205
So if I can surround myself with individuals who can help

402
00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:47.845
with both fronts, my personal, you know, journey

403
00:17:47.905 --> 00:17:50.485
of being self-sufficient, starting my own business,

404
00:17:50.485 --> 00:17:52.205
making an impact, developing

405
00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.485
and driving my own personal product,

406
00:17:53.905 --> 00:17:55.245
or entering the tech field

407
00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:57.925
and benefiting that way, um,

408
00:17:58.145 --> 00:18:00.765
it would be a huge multiplier for me.

409
00:18:02.065 --> 00:18:04.005
Got it. No, thanks for outlining that.

410
00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:05.565
That's pretty, it's a good

411
00:18:05.565 --> 00:18:06.965
understanding of how this also works.

412
00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:11.125
Um, so what a lot of people come to us for is mentorship,

413
00:18:11.505 --> 00:18:14.165
um, or a job, right?

414
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:18.165
Um, and people are looking for the same things.

415
00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:19.245
People are looking to hire,

416
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.605
people are looking for that talent.

417
00:18:20.605 --> 00:18:21.725
People are looking to invest.

418
00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:24.605
So there is a relationship that happens that, that,

419
00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:27.245
that exists across the people in the network as well.

420
00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:29.445
And so, um, so great, that kind

421
00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:30.885
of answers kind of two things, right?

422
00:18:30.885 --> 00:18:32.765
You went over the bio part, you went over the cycle part,

423
00:18:33.065 --> 00:18:35.285
um, to you elaborate a little bit more.

424
00:18:35.385 --> 00:18:37.325
And typically what happens when I work with folks

425
00:18:37.325 --> 00:18:42.085
that are kind of in your position is, um, I mean,

426
00:18:42.085 --> 00:18:45.445
the first three months that we actively work with someone is

427
00:18:45.975 --> 00:18:50.505
we're getting to understand how you actually do work,

428
00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:53.765
how you communicate, what your drive is like,

429
00:18:54.225 --> 00:18:56.405
how proactive you can be, how easily,

430
00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:59.605
or how well you can synthesize and information,

431
00:19:00.265 --> 00:19:03.365
and kind of get the main points out of the, the information

432
00:19:03.365 --> 00:19:04.565
that's gonna be thrown at you.

433
00:19:04.885 --> 00:19:09.045
There'll be a lot of things that, um, so hey, uh, and myself

434
00:19:09.065 --> 00:19:11.365
or someone else will kind of throw in in things like the

435
00:19:11.365 --> 00:19:13.125
group chat, for example, on WhatsApp.

436
00:19:13.475 --> 00:19:14.525
It's a lot of information.

437
00:19:16.575 --> 00:19:19.335
A lot of it is important, A lot of it, uh, is relevant.

438
00:19:19.655 --> 00:19:21.615
I mean, all of it is relevant and important, uh,

439
00:19:21.635 --> 00:19:23.335
but it's understanding what to get out of that

440
00:19:23.535 --> 00:19:27.215
that's gonna be relevant to you and where, uh, uh,

441
00:19:28.675 --> 00:19:30.495
and, and what to do with that information.

442
00:19:31.035 --> 00:19:33.365
So analysts

443
00:19:33.365 --> 00:19:36.635
that we have, that's their job, right?

444
00:19:36.825 --> 00:19:39.115
It's, it's to get the main points

445
00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:40.755
and figure out what to do with the information.

446
00:19:41.925 --> 00:19:45.285
And that depends on the area that you're in.

447
00:19:45.305 --> 00:19:48.085
We have folks that are specific to pharmacy.

448
00:19:48.655 --> 00:19:51.245
There are folks that are specific to, um, you know,

449
00:19:51.245 --> 00:19:53.205
anthropology or, or things like that.

450
00:19:53.265 --> 00:19:56.605
And so, um, we have like other seasoned physicians

451
00:19:56.835 --> 00:19:59.245
that are in those areas already, that have given talks

452
00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:02.885
that have been in different innovation hours with us, where,

453
00:20:03.585 --> 00:20:06.005
uh, which is, um, an event

454
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:09.005
where we have typically one main subject matter expert

455
00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:11.485
joined by a few other folks that are in related fields,

456
00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:13.485
but not the same one that offer their insights

457
00:20:13.485 --> 00:20:15.405
that are related to the topic.

458
00:20:15.665 --> 00:20:17.925
Mm-Hmm. So for example, we've had like an innovation hour on

459
00:20:17.975 --> 00:20:21.645
brain health where we've had a neurologist, we've had

460
00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:23.365
a spiritual advisor,

461
00:20:24.255 --> 00:20:26.525
Brain something, brain Health.

462
00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:28.325
Brain health, okay?

463
00:20:28.895 --> 00:20:31.005
Right? You have someone that works directly

464
00:20:31.005 --> 00:20:33.845
with like the organic material of the brain.

465
00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:36.005
They have someone that works with this, that

466
00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:37.085
with spiritual guidance.

467
00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.925
You have someone that is like a counselor

468
00:20:39.045 --> 00:20:41.205
and they're gonna have three very different perspectives on

469
00:20:41.205 --> 00:20:42.645
what brain health even means.

470
00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:46.645
But those are events where, um, you know, we've,

471
00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:50.075
we've got folks that provide their expertise

472
00:20:50.075 --> 00:20:53.955
and information, and part of an analyst job is to, you know,

473
00:20:54.015 --> 00:20:56.235
get the main points of what that was and,

474
00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:59.275
and share kind of the, the insights that come out

475
00:20:59.275 --> 00:21:01.755
of an event like that amongst other work

476
00:21:01.755 --> 00:21:03.355
that the folks involved are doing.

477
00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:07.395
Um, right. To create, you know, a, uh,

478
00:21:10.025 --> 00:21:14.415
um, a connection

479
00:21:14.415 --> 00:21:16.175
between the, the parties involved, right?

480
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.335
Because there is a connection. It all exists.

481
00:21:18.515 --> 00:21:21.055
Um, and the purpose of an analyst is

482
00:21:21.055 --> 00:21:22.455
to make do with that information.

483
00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:25.255
So, uh, so that's what typically how it works.

484
00:21:25.355 --> 00:21:28.615
The first three months, you know, we, we set up like kind

485
00:21:28.615 --> 00:21:30.055
of certain hours of the week.

486
00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:33.335
It's usually five to 10 hours depending on the scope

487
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:36.135
of the work and where you are and what you're dealing with

488
00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:38.935
and, and what projects we've got lined up, um,

489
00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:41.735
that way then we see like how much time you're spending,

490
00:21:41.755 --> 00:21:43.135
and again, how you operate

491
00:21:43.155 --> 00:21:47.575
and how well you work, uh, which then can lead

492
00:21:47.575 --> 00:21:51.735
to like a, um, you know, like a paid position and also, or,

493
00:21:51.835 --> 00:21:54.255
or, or you know, what you said you were looking for,

494
00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:55.695
which is mentorship and

495
00:21:56.145 --> 00:21:57.145
Right.

496
00:21:57.205 --> 00:21:58.415
With other folks that might be more

497
00:21:58.575 --> 00:21:59.655
specific to what you're looking for as well.

498
00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:03.675
So that's a little bit to give you an idea of what

499
00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:04.835
that kind of looks like.

500
00:22:06.665 --> 00:22:10.565
Um, now the other two parts, there's Biocycle social

501
00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:14.645
and what that is, is like who are the three parties

502
00:22:15.395 --> 00:22:17.165
that kind of inspire you most

503
00:22:17.165 --> 00:22:21.655
or have the most influence on you in your life, right?

504
00:22:23.545 --> 00:22:26.605
So you're thinking about that as you're thinking about that.

505
00:22:26.675 --> 00:22:29.685
It's typically what I hear is people mention a parent,

506
00:22:29.745 --> 00:22:31.085
or both parents or a guardian.

507
00:22:31.825 --> 00:22:33.445
People mention maybe Imam

508
00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:38.005
or spiritual advisor family, a partner,

509
00:22:39.305 --> 00:22:40.945
a mentor, or someone they don't know,

510
00:22:40.965 --> 00:22:45.295
but someone that they, you know, they are heavily influenced

511
00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:46.495
by, you know, like some sort

512
00:22:46.495 --> 00:22:47.855
of leader out in the world as well.

513
00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:54.115
Good one. Um, Take a second.

514
00:22:56.055 --> 00:22:59.065
This may be very cliche or over over spoken,

515
00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:01.665
but there's the prophet mohamad sarana.

516
00:23:02.245 --> 00:23:05.905
Um, like for the past few months, like I listened

517
00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:08.465
to the, and it's different.

518
00:23:08.465 --> 00:23:11.305
Like I grew up and I went to a Muslim school, uh,

519
00:23:11.425 --> 00:23:14.445
I learned about everything, and then I went to college.

520
00:23:14.505 --> 00:23:15.925
And you don't forget all of that,

521
00:23:15.945 --> 00:23:18.285
but it, it loses a little bit of its relevance.

522
00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:20.165
You're stuck in the material world,

523
00:23:20.285 --> 00:23:21.965
learning about science is hard, facts,

524
00:23:22.075 --> 00:23:23.165
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

525
00:23:23.385 --> 00:23:25.125
And unless you're in the MSA

526
00:23:25.145 --> 00:23:28.565
or around Muslim, uh, youth like you, it slowly,

527
00:23:28.625 --> 00:23:30.325
slowly starts to slip away from you.

528
00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:35.605
And the thing about, uh, Islam is, yes, it was taught to us

529
00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:38.605
as children, but it's much, much more relevant to us,

530
00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:40.285
especially as we slowly become adults.

531
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.265
So then you learn like the majority

532
00:23:43.265 --> 00:23:46.445
of the cido was about him in full blown adulthood.

533
00:23:47.225 --> 00:23:48.685
And there's a lot of tendencies.

534
00:23:48.805 --> 00:23:50.045
I have had a lot of outlooks.

535
00:23:50.085 --> 00:23:52.965
I may have had a lot of pasts in life I was about to take,

536
00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:57.125
but I switched them because, well, Moham was my age,

537
00:23:57.385 --> 00:23:59.645
or he was speaking to people my age completely differently.

538
00:24:00.465 --> 00:24:04.515
So it's more so like reinterpreting everything I learned

539
00:24:04.515 --> 00:24:06.915
as a child, and it's becoming more

540
00:24:06.915 --> 00:24:08.315
and more relevant as I age,

541
00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:11.475
and as I face more things that I didn't expect to face,

542
00:24:11.475 --> 00:24:12.795
and difficulties as such.

543
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:15.955
Um, so number one would be my prophet ham.

544
00:24:17.395 --> 00:24:20.535
Number two would be my father.

545
00:24:21.675 --> 00:24:24.735
Um, my father is an interesting individual.

546
00:24:24.955 --> 00:24:29.895
Um, if you are familiar with Dallas, um, about

547
00:24:30.445 --> 00:24:33.575
four of the major messages were either completely designed

548
00:24:33.575 --> 00:24:35.135
by him or heavily influenced by him.

549
00:24:35.395 --> 00:24:38.495
So he, he's the architect of guy, he's the architect

550
00:24:38.495 --> 00:24:40.055
of Bright Horizons, the S school I went to.

551
00:24:40.485 --> 00:24:43.975
He's the architect of the, he worked

552
00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:45.335
with the people at Epic Valley

553
00:24:45.335 --> 00:24:46.615
Ranch and a lot of different massa.

554
00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:50.905
And growing up I was like, oh, that's just my dad.

555
00:24:51.695 --> 00:24:53.195
And then solely, I'm like, wait a minute.

556
00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:57.595
He came from ACH and he was my age when he got to America.

557
00:24:58.595 --> 00:25:01.615
And Alou, his father already passed away

558
00:25:02.515 --> 00:25:06.095
and his mother was by herself and his sister was, was off.

559
00:25:06.675 --> 00:25:09.255
And this was the period of, of ak uh,

560
00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:11.335
solely becoming more and more destabilized.

561
00:25:11.335 --> 00:25:13.095
And he didn't just come anywhere to America.

562
00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:15.215
He went to MIT Mahala.

563
00:25:15.515 --> 00:25:18.175
And then I learned he was the number two in all of Radha in,

564
00:25:18.235 --> 00:25:19.775
uh, the Bachelorate.

565
00:25:19.795 --> 00:25:23.575
He, he's extremely, extremely, extremely, um, driven.

566
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:26.975
And a lot of the time when we see driven individuals on

567
00:25:26.975 --> 00:25:28.935
social media, it's ice baths,

568
00:25:29.005 --> 00:25:31.215
it's morning routines, it's this and that.

569
00:25:31.555 --> 00:25:32.775
And it's like, I'm like, oh yeah,

570
00:25:32.775 --> 00:25:34.735
these are all these driven people, David Goggins and such.

571
00:25:34.735 --> 00:25:36.695
And then it's like, wait a minute. My father

572
00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:40.175
for the last five decades has without fail, gotten up

573
00:25:41.345 --> 00:25:45.005
and make huge changes in the world around him.

574
00:25:45.395 --> 00:25:47.445
It's like, as a 20-year-old, you're starting to like,

575
00:25:48.085 --> 00:25:49.605
discover what it's like to actually have

576
00:25:49.605 --> 00:25:50.725
an impact on something.

577
00:25:51.365 --> 00:25:52.645
'cause I was being raised slowly,

578
00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:54.565
and now it's time for me to produce results.

579
00:25:55.105 --> 00:25:56.245
And he's been doing this

580
00:25:56.465 --> 00:25:58.525
for three times my life, essentially.

581
00:25:59.185 --> 00:26:01.685
So it's like that, you know, humanization

582
00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:06.275
of your father from father figure to this life story

583
00:26:06.275 --> 00:26:09.395
that you're slowly, slowly, slowly starting to catch up on.

584
00:26:09.495 --> 00:26:11.475
So I would say my father for that reason, um,

585
00:26:12.255 --> 00:26:14.835
the older I get, the more I'm learning from him and ela.

586
00:26:15.335 --> 00:26:20.015
Um, and the main thing is to, that I'm getting from him, is

587
00:26:22.065 --> 00:26:24.565
to be the thing you do, if that makes sense.

588
00:26:25.025 --> 00:26:28.405
So an example like my dad, when he's designing something,

589
00:26:29.225 --> 00:26:31.215
architects usually pass off their design

590
00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:33.295
and they make a new design.

591
00:26:33.885 --> 00:26:36.415
He's at the construction site being the superintendent.

592
00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:39.015
He knows about concrete, concrete mixing.

593
00:26:39.015 --> 00:26:40.775
He knows about rebar, he knows about this.

594
00:26:41.165 --> 00:26:44.165
He's catching mistakes that save stake the builders million,

595
00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:45.845
literally millions and millions of dollars.

596
00:26:46.035 --> 00:26:47.445
He's right now in like a lawsuit.

597
00:26:47.905 --> 00:26:50.965
And he is very competent in legal litre like, uh,

598
00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:52.365
I did real estate on the side.

599
00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:55.315
And then he would be like, check this contract.

600
00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:56.915
And I'm like, how do you know all of this stuff?

601
00:26:57.495 --> 00:27:00.915
So he is what he does, meaning as an architect, like he,

602
00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:03.555
he's drawn like a little web, like a spider web

603
00:27:03.745 --> 00:27:05.755
with a being architected at the center of it.

604
00:27:05.935 --> 00:27:08.555
But then there's civil engineer, electrical engineer,

605
00:27:08.725 --> 00:27:10.235
everything that touches him.

606
00:27:10.855 --> 00:27:12.275
He is well acquainted with it.

607
00:27:12.455 --> 00:27:15.925
And he's a very, um, if you were to now characterize him,

608
00:27:15.925 --> 00:27:17.565
he's very skeptical, very cynical.

609
00:27:17.835 --> 00:27:21.085
He's always, always, always questioning. He does.

610
00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:23.445
But because he's always on the lookout for being cheated or

611
00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:26.445
or pardon of my language, bss, right?

612
00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:28.205
Yeah. So he's like, I'm not gonna let

613
00:27:28.205 --> 00:27:29.445
anyone tell me how it is.

614
00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:33.025
I'm gonna learn my world so that I tell people

615
00:27:33.125 --> 00:27:34.265
how I want my dream.

616
00:27:34.695 --> 00:27:38.545
Yeah. And then lo and you have, um, the Dallas, uh,

617
00:27:38.735 --> 00:27:40.655
he's built also churches,

618
00:27:40.795 --> 00:27:44.375
and he built, um, Waco's, uh, train stop.

619
00:27:44.445 --> 00:27:46.015
He's built the dart system,

620
00:27:46.195 --> 00:27:48.375
or he contributed to the dart system in, in Dallas.

621
00:27:48.555 --> 00:27:51.655
So Alah like, now you take a building

622
00:27:51.715 --> 00:27:54.055
and then you, you, you zoom out and I see my father,

623
00:27:54.795 --> 00:27:57.105
and then a third one.

624
00:27:59.925 --> 00:28:03.915
That's a good one. Maybe that's an empty spot right now.

625
00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:07.995
Um, if I were to be listening a lot to, uh,

626
00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:11.995
advice from social media gurus, uh, it would be split

627
00:28:11.995 --> 00:28:13.915
between, if you know Alex Ramzi?

628
00:28:15.855 --> 00:28:19.175
I don't think so. Uh, he's, he is, he is a new, like,

629
00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:20.935
um, sensation.

630
00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:25.855
He is all about, uh, generating leads, turning how

631
00:28:25.855 --> 00:28:27.535
to talk to people when you're selling to them.

632
00:28:28.315 --> 00:28:32.245
Uh, and then Chris Voss who wrote, uh, never split the,

633
00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:35.945
I like, I like the way he teaches you to talk to people, um,

634
00:28:36.245 --> 00:28:38.025
to understand what they're saying

635
00:28:38.085 --> 00:28:40.585
so you can actually communicate with them instead

636
00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:41.665
of just talking to their face.

637
00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:44.785
Like, uh, I read this book when I was a little bit younger,

638
00:28:44.845 --> 00:28:46.705
but it did actually affect me growing up.

639
00:28:47.085 --> 00:28:48.585
Uh, like in the way I deal with people,

640
00:28:49.405 --> 00:28:51.895
it's like he's all about negotiating isn't convincing

641
00:28:51.895 --> 00:28:54.415
someone, it's listening to them

642
00:28:54.415 --> 00:28:55.895
to see if you can actually work with them.

643
00:28:57.075 --> 00:29:01.295
Uh, and especially business, it's like yesterday or the day

644
00:29:01.295 --> 00:29:02.615
before, I was at a car dealership

645
00:29:03.155 --> 00:29:06.575
and, uh, for whatever reason, like, uh, my father was there

646
00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:08.535
and we were buying, we were both buying a car for my wife.

647
00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:12.575
Uh, the loan, the 0% a PR finance loan wasn't going through

648
00:29:12.575 --> 00:29:13.855
because a mistake the dealership made.

649
00:29:14.395 --> 00:29:17.325
And my dad usually gets extremely, extremely frustrated

650
00:29:17.325 --> 00:29:20.365
with these things slowly as nothing gets fixed.

651
00:29:20.945 --> 00:29:23.845
And I'm usually used to my dad, like not raising his voice,

652
00:29:23.865 --> 00:29:25.885
but becoming much sterner and frustrated,

653
00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:27.445
and he walks out and they lose the business.

654
00:29:27.985 --> 00:29:30.285
And this guy kept saying, I understand. No.

655
00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:32.045
And like, he let my father explain the point,

656
00:29:32.465 --> 00:29:34.805
and I realized my father wasn't frustrated anymore

657
00:29:34.805 --> 00:29:36.045
because he was understood.

658
00:29:36.345 --> 00:29:37.845
The situation didn't change whatsoever.

659
00:29:38.905 --> 00:29:41.445
And my father wasn't helped at all. But he was understood.

660
00:29:42.375 --> 00:29:43.875
And then at the end of the day, yes,

661
00:29:43.995 --> 00:29:45.275
a a solution was, was given.

662
00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:48.035
But like, it was very obvious too, like,

663
00:29:48.415 --> 00:29:49.915
almost like he read the book yesterday.

664
00:29:50.175 --> 00:29:51.875
The guy would just say, I understand

665
00:29:51.945 --> 00:29:53.115
that must be frustrating.

666
00:29:53.355 --> 00:29:54.435
I completely understand.

667
00:29:54.775 --> 00:29:56.435
And he would say, I can't help you, but I understand.

668
00:29:57.015 --> 00:29:58.435
And then like after 40 minutes of that,

669
00:29:58.435 --> 00:30:00.745
like my dad wasn't, he was like, okay.

670
00:30:00.895 --> 00:30:03.385
Like he understood the situation he was in objectively

671
00:30:03.495 --> 00:30:05.825
without being frustrated, if that makes sense.

672
00:30:06.815 --> 00:30:11.225
Yeah. So That was a big, uh,

673
00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:12.665
turning point, I would say,

674
00:30:12.665 --> 00:30:13.865
in the way I learned to talk to people.

675
00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:18.415
Got it. And the reason we asked question is

676
00:30:18.415 --> 00:30:21.135
because you are, you know, you're typically the product

677
00:30:21.195 --> 00:30:26.045
of the people that you listen to the most, right?

678
00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:29.975
Um, and I can tell

679
00:30:31.725 --> 00:30:33.625
how they influence you, right?

680
00:30:34.505 --> 00:30:35.545
I could hear it. Um,

681
00:30:37.005 --> 00:30:39.945
and it, it in some ways feeds into the next question too,

682
00:30:39.945 --> 00:30:43.945
which is, so this biopsychosocial

683
00:30:44.205 --> 00:30:48.825
and then spiritual or analog, uh, meaning what

684
00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:50.945
values do you have?

685
00:30:51.095 --> 00:30:55.755
What guides you in life that you know isn't from someone,

686
00:30:56.775 --> 00:31:00.155
um, or your work or your personal ambitions, right?

687
00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.155
Typically it's religion for people.

688
00:31:03.295 --> 00:31:05.515
For those who don't have like an active faith,

689
00:31:05.515 --> 00:31:07.915
there is some sort of system that they do follow.

690
00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:13.335
Um, I don't come across anyone in the network that's like,

691
00:31:13.395 --> 00:31:16.055
I'm just doing whatever.

692
00:31:16.115 --> 00:31:17.655
You know? There's, there's always a system,

693
00:31:17.655 --> 00:31:19.055
even if it's someone that doesn't have

694
00:31:19.275 --> 00:31:21.375
or adhere to a certain faith.

695
00:31:22.115 --> 00:31:25.185
Um, so what's that for you?

696
00:31:28.155 --> 00:31:32.085
I would say it's trying to remain

697
00:31:32.655 --> 00:31:37.255
fully aware, um, Muslim to Muslim, that I only get one

698
00:31:37.255 --> 00:31:39.335
of these very, very, very, very short lifes.

699
00:31:40.695 --> 00:31:44.635
And as much as it sounds awkward,

700
00:31:45.095 --> 00:31:47.715
the majority of what I'm gonna be spending my time doing is

701
00:31:47.755 --> 00:31:52.065
a distraction unless I turn it into something pertaining

702
00:31:52.065 --> 00:31:53.305
to a form of worship.

703
00:31:54.165 --> 00:31:57.825
And worship doesn't just mean, you know, the religious acts

704
00:31:57.825 --> 00:31:59.585
that you do at the me or making

705
00:32:00.025 --> 00:32:02.785
or whatever, an act of worship can just be,

706
00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:06.275
or trying your best at what you do.

707
00:32:07.005 --> 00:32:08.425
Um, and without that,

708
00:32:08.645 --> 00:32:10.865
people get untethered and they become lost.

709
00:32:11.735 --> 00:32:13.675
So I would say, like, my anchor is,

710
00:32:15.265 --> 00:32:17.185
I only get a few seconds on this planet,

711
00:32:17.275 --> 00:32:18.305
relatively speaking,

712
00:32:19.395 --> 00:32:22.895
and everything around me has existed for powers

713
00:32:22.895 --> 00:32:24.255
of 10 more than I've been here.

714
00:32:25.395 --> 00:32:29.485
So a that put me here,

715
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.395
and he gave me the same shot he gave everyone else a shot

716
00:32:33.395 --> 00:32:37.655
at, and also a shot at the worst position in Johanna.

717
00:32:38.305 --> 00:32:41.505
And this test, Allah already knows what's in our heart.

718
00:32:42.285 --> 00:32:45.575
It's a mercy for us, so that we'll have something

719
00:32:45.575 --> 00:32:47.215
to characterize the way we acted.

720
00:32:48.685 --> 00:32:50.535
It's, it's me who got up and prayed,

721
00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:54.255
or it's me who decided I'm not going to, it's me who gave in

722
00:32:54.255 --> 00:32:56.735
and rationalized temptations versus me who saved them off.

723
00:32:57.525 --> 00:32:59.255
It's all just a self-reflection.

724
00:32:59.315 --> 00:33:01.975
And Islam tells us that so

725
00:33:01.975 --> 00:33:05.015
that we're not completely heartbroken at the way

726
00:33:05.015 --> 00:33:06.055
our life is turning out.

727
00:33:06.765 --> 00:33:09.695
Like, I realize you can make the rah, oh, Allah give me gen

728
00:33:10.265 --> 00:33:11.695
Allah, gimme gen for those,

729
00:33:12.855 --> 00:33:14.555
but he never promised us we're gonna understand

730
00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:17.075
how our life immediately changes because of that prayer.

731
00:33:18.035 --> 00:33:21.765
Meaning nothing in my life has turned out as expected.

732
00:33:22.565 --> 00:33:25.385
And the majority of it has been quote unquote disappointing

733
00:33:25.645 --> 00:33:28.105
or frustrating or more complex than I was ready

734
00:33:28.105 --> 00:33:29.945
to handle, or difficult.

735
00:33:30.485 --> 00:33:32.305
And it turns out well, I made a prayer

736
00:33:32.325 --> 00:33:35.145
or I was going into this new phase of life as

737
00:33:35.715 --> 00:33:40.535
this actual human being, and then I got hit with reality.

738
00:33:41.495 --> 00:33:42.915
And then every single time that happens,

739
00:33:42.975 --> 00:33:45.635
you solely become more accustomed to letting go

740
00:33:46.615 --> 00:33:51.455
or saying, as long as I check these boxes, the majority

741
00:33:51.475 --> 00:33:52.975
of the boxes around me aren't going

742
00:33:52.975 --> 00:33:54.215
to be able to be checked by me.

743
00:33:54.215 --> 00:33:55.695
They're not within my influence.

744
00:33:56.515 --> 00:33:58.895
And then solely, you start to branch out

745
00:33:58.895 --> 00:34:01.895
to other non-Islamic things, and it's all about stoicism,

746
00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:03.895
or it's all about letting this go,

747
00:34:03.955 --> 00:34:05.895
or it's all about losing materialism.

748
00:34:05.895 --> 00:34:10.485
But the reality of it is, it's like, uh, a lu

749
00:34:11.025 --> 00:34:13.835
is going to put you in a position

750
00:34:14.795 --> 00:34:16.785
where it's just enough that you can handle it,

751
00:34:18.135 --> 00:34:21.155
but you can only do so at the cost of growing.

752
00:34:23.815 --> 00:34:26.435
And, uh, if you, and of course those are great words

753
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:29.795
and all, but if you have to put them into practice,

754
00:34:30.655 --> 00:34:32.915
if you have to live by them, it's a whole different story

755
00:34:33.975 --> 00:34:35.425
because then there's no one around

756
00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:37.145
to record the testament of your effort.

757
00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:38.305
And then it's left on faith.

758
00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:40.385
Like, is this really gonna be remembered?

759
00:34:40.405 --> 00:34:42.545
Am I gonna really get a reward for this?

760
00:34:42.605 --> 00:34:45.385
And then that's a whole different game, which I'm trying

761
00:34:45.385 --> 00:34:47.025
to reconcile with ela,

762
00:34:47.025 --> 00:34:50.775
but that's what has been guiding me to make any major

763
00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:52.695
or minor decision in the last few years.

764
00:34:59.535 --> 00:35:01.435
It seems like you've got, you've had a good support

765
00:35:03.535 --> 00:35:06.225
growing, grown up and now as well.

766
00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:08.585
I was put in the right environment

767
00:35:09.325 --> 00:35:12.745
and my father told me what is correct,

768
00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:18.435
but he didn't coerce me into making the correct decision.

769
00:35:18.975 --> 00:35:22.845
So there's been doors that have been opened to me

770
00:35:23.635 --> 00:35:25.285
that you can't walk back out of.

771
00:35:25.985 --> 00:35:29.045
Um, and then the only thing that kind of carried me through

772
00:35:29.105 --> 00:35:30.245
to make the right decision,

773
00:35:30.245 --> 00:35:31.565
because I, at the end of the day had

774
00:35:31.565 --> 00:35:34.165
to make the right decision, was him very early on telling

775
00:35:34.185 --> 00:35:38.915
me, it's like the real Islam isn't when your parent

776
00:35:39.065 --> 00:35:40.875
teaches you, teaches you, teaches you.

777
00:35:40.895 --> 00:35:42.155
And then once you reach adulthood,

778
00:35:42.855 --> 00:35:44.355
it all falls apart after that.

779
00:35:45.025 --> 00:35:47.435
It's like you have to actually have the bad

780
00:35:47.495 --> 00:35:49.875
or sobering experiences yourself when you're younger.

781
00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:51.935
So my father was a teacher,

782
00:35:52.515 --> 00:35:56.175
but not as much of an enforcer, which kind

783
00:35:56.175 --> 00:35:57.335
of made me sit down

784
00:35:57.395 --> 00:35:59.455
and I was like weighing options when I was a lot younger.

785
00:35:59.775 --> 00:36:01.495
I didn't like any of it, like having

786
00:36:01.495 --> 00:36:03.495
to rationalize, do I do what I want?

787
00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:05.535
Do I do, what he told me about is,

788
00:36:05.835 --> 00:36:07.495
and then you have to reconcile a lot.

789
00:36:08.075 --> 00:36:11.575
So it was more of a, he put me right in the Petri dish

790
00:36:12.495 --> 00:36:16.275
and he let whatever result come come about ela, which was,

791
00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:20.265
which was essentially how you raise someone, in my opinion.

792
00:36:20.765 --> 00:36:22.345
Of course, he wasn't completely absent

793
00:36:22.365 --> 00:36:26.225
and he wouldn't, uh, like be not abuse

794
00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:29.305
or at the end of the day, he kind of miraculously,

795
00:36:29.385 --> 00:36:31.185
'cause he was a helicopter dad, funny enough.

796
00:36:31.845 --> 00:36:33.735
But when it came to my religion,

797
00:36:35.315 --> 00:36:36.825
there was no helicopter dad.

798
00:36:36.965 --> 00:36:38.705
Mm-Hmm. He wasn't on me. Right.

799
00:36:38.725 --> 00:36:40.145
He wasn't on me going Be put on,

800
00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:41.465
go on fast, you need to be doing this.

801
00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:45.095
He would be doing it, and then there would be a spot right

802
00:36:45.095 --> 00:36:46.695
next to him to pray or, or to not pray.

803
00:36:47.235 --> 00:36:49.295
And eventually I, I made one of two decisions.

804
00:36:51.565 --> 00:36:56.015
Yeah. No, in a lot of ways it reminds my dad too. Yeah.

805
00:36:56.035 --> 00:36:59.805
You know, my dad, um, I mean,

806
00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:02.725
in some ways similar story, he ended up, he came

807
00:37:02.745 --> 00:37:04.525
to the US for college.

808
00:37:05.965 --> 00:37:07.705
Uh, he was pursuing like engineering

809
00:37:07.855 --> 00:37:09.465
immigration issues popped up.

810
00:37:09.845 --> 00:37:13.015
Um, he ended up ha working in food service

811
00:37:13.435 --> 00:37:16.615
and then had worked in food service ever since, you know,

812
00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:19.625
and he liked it

813
00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:22.385
because of the relationships he built with people, you know?

814
00:37:22.385 --> 00:37:24.865
Mm-Hmm. He worked in like a corporate setting for a while.

815
00:37:24.865 --> 00:37:26.625
He worked at like a fine French restaurant,

816
00:37:27.595 --> 00:37:28.895
opened up our own restaurant

817
00:37:28.895 --> 00:37:32.925
because he wanted to make sure there was a source of like,

818
00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:36.965
food for people in Wichita, Kansas, you know?

819
00:37:37.305 --> 00:37:40.365
Mm-Hmm. And to make sure that the, the sole work

820
00:37:40.365 --> 00:37:44.725
that he did was in accordance to Islamic law.

821
00:37:46.185 --> 00:37:49.005
And um, you know, and there was a cost to it.

822
00:37:49.265 --> 00:37:51.685
You know, it's, the food business is very tough.

823
00:37:51.795 --> 00:37:53.645
It's up and down frequently. Right.

824
00:37:54.145 --> 00:37:56.595
The restaurant is like one to start.

825
00:37:57.305 --> 00:38:01.035
Yeah. And, uh, you know, my mother came into that as well.

826
00:38:01.185 --> 00:38:03.355
It's not like she wanted to be a cook or whatnot.

827
00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:05.195
She was, uh, she kind of made clothes at home,

828
00:38:05.195 --> 00:38:06.595
basically what she used to do.

829
00:38:07.335 --> 00:38:09.275
And then, uh, since then, we, both of them work

830
00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:12.795
all the time, you know, just to maintain kinda

831
00:38:12.795 --> 00:38:16.835
what they got going on and, uh, all always

832
00:38:17.665 --> 00:38:21.195
wanting me and my siblings, I got two younger siblings, uh,

833
00:38:21.375 --> 00:38:23.795
you know, um, one of 'em is Kansas City, one

834
00:38:23.795 --> 00:38:25.755
of them is in Wichita, so she's finishing school.

835
00:38:26.615 --> 00:38:29.545
Um, and uh,

836
00:38:31.255 --> 00:38:33.275
my dad is like a very disciplined person.

837
00:38:33.975 --> 00:38:36.805
My mom, my mom is a very hardworking person,

838
00:38:37.145 --> 00:38:41.475
but my dad like would be up early,

839
00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:44.155
he'd be getting his things done,

840
00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:45.835
and he would move on to the next thing.

841
00:38:46.935 --> 00:38:49.955
He also, similar to what you mentioned, like about your dad,

842
00:38:49.955 --> 00:38:51.395
about being very particular

843
00:38:51.575 --> 00:38:52.595
and like,

844
00:38:53.135 --> 00:38:55.715
not letting anyone cheat him or something like that.

845
00:38:55.975 --> 00:38:59.835
You know, I hear that in my dad's in the way.

846
00:38:59.835 --> 00:39:01.075
He talks about certain things sometimes,

847
00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:03.715
And it drives you, your kid,

848
00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:05.515
it drives you mad when you're a kid

849
00:39:05.515 --> 00:39:06.795
and then you get a little older and you're like,

850
00:39:06.795 --> 00:39:07.875
Hey, I kind of get it now.

851
00:39:08.695 --> 00:39:11.235
So it like yeah, the cynicism, yeah, it comes across

852
00:39:11.335 --> 00:39:16.255
as a little like, um, like, oh,

853
00:39:16.255 --> 00:39:17.375
people aren't as bad.

854
00:39:17.435 --> 00:39:20.415
But then at the same time, you know, there's, it's, you deal

855
00:39:20.415 --> 00:39:21.895
with enough people in your line

856
00:39:21.895 --> 00:39:23.495
of work when you know your field

857
00:39:23.635 --> 00:39:26.615
and you know your stuff, uh, you know who doesn't

858
00:39:26.715 --> 00:39:29.615
and who's trying to abuse it, uh, abuse the relationship.

859
00:39:29.755 --> 00:39:31.375
So I get what you're saying in a

860
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:32.695
quite a few things that you mentioned.

861
00:39:32.875 --> 00:39:34.655
Um, and thanks again for going over all of that.

862
00:39:34.655 --> 00:39:37.375
The whole purpose of having this conversation is, is always

863
00:39:37.435 --> 00:39:40.255
to have a better understanding of who someone is,

864
00:39:40.765 --> 00:39:42.295
what has made them who they are.

865
00:39:43.315 --> 00:39:47.895
And, um, you know, uh, it makes it easier to understand

866
00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:51.375
the person behind the work

867
00:39:51.515 --> 00:39:53.135
and the relationships that we've built,

868
00:39:53.135 --> 00:39:55.975
especially when we introduce people to each other.

869
00:39:57.235 --> 00:39:59.855
Um, it's a big difference between us

870
00:39:59.955 --> 00:40:01.615
and maybe other networking groups

871
00:40:01.705 --> 00:40:06.575
where people are looking at the credentials on paper

872
00:40:06.835 --> 00:40:10.015
and the base level in character

873
00:40:10.195 --> 00:40:14.295
or personality of someone, um, which is fine for

874
00:40:14.295 --> 00:40:16.375
what it might be, but that's not what we're doing.

875
00:40:16.515 --> 00:40:20.525
So, um, so anyway, thanks for going over all that.

876
00:40:20.745 --> 00:40:25.295
Um, typically what happens next is, um,

877
00:40:25.975 --> 00:40:27.655
I mean as far as like scheduling

878
00:40:27.655 --> 00:40:32.615
and whatnot goes, what does, how, how busy do you tend to be

879
00:40:32.615 --> 00:40:34.495
through the week and over the next few months?

880
00:40:35.615 --> 00:40:37.265
Good question. So I'm like,

881
00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.345
I threw up everything in the air

882
00:40:39.345 --> 00:40:41.225
and I have several options to choose from.

883
00:40:41.765 --> 00:40:46.375
So if no change in my life,

884
00:40:46.875 --> 00:40:50.215
um, I'm gonna be on winter break for a good while.

885
00:40:50.475 --> 00:40:53.015
Uh, I will be gone on vacation for like the next week,

886
00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:56.655
plus a few days, but after that I'll be off essentially.

887
00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:00.535
Um, after that I only have college classes, uh,

888
00:41:00.535 --> 00:41:04.145
master's on Monday and Wednesday from like two to five.

889
00:41:04.325 --> 00:41:06.865
And then I'm free for the rest of the week, week.

890
00:41:06.865 --> 00:41:08.185
That's if I continue

891
00:41:08.185 --> 00:41:09.905
with my master's and I don't put a pause.

892
00:41:10.425 --> 00:41:13.425
I have applied to a AI company in Irving

893
00:41:14.385 --> 00:41:16.005
and I got to the final interview

894
00:41:16.025 --> 00:41:19.485
and the COO was kind of hinting to me

895
00:41:19.485 --> 00:41:21.685
that he's gonna give his personal preference.

896
00:41:21.685 --> 00:41:23.645
And everyone who interviewed me kind of said they're going

897
00:41:23.645 --> 00:41:25.725
to try to put a word in for me.

898
00:41:26.425 --> 00:41:29.645
Um, but it's just the word at the end of the day

899
00:41:29.645 --> 00:41:30.685
until you get a response.

900
00:41:31.265 --> 00:41:32.805
And being the end of December,

901
00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:35.725
I'm not gonna hear anything most likely until mid-January.

902
00:41:36.265 --> 00:41:39.445
So that's kind of a bit confusing,

903
00:41:39.465 --> 00:41:41.965
but I mean, people are kind of used to having a lot

904
00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:43.365
of things hanging in there at once.

905
00:41:44.415 --> 00:41:47.875
So if I have a full-time job,

906
00:41:48.355 --> 00:41:49.595
I guess I would be like most people

907
00:41:49.605 --> 00:41:52.155
where I'm only available in the evenings or the weekends.

908
00:41:53.075 --> 00:41:57.565
Yeah. Um, but okay. I hope that good know.

909
00:41:58.705 --> 00:42:03.245
Yeah, that helps. Um, typically what we're, you know,

910
00:42:03.245 --> 00:42:04.965
it's like typically five hours a week

911
00:42:04.965 --> 00:42:06.605
that we work in the first three months

912
00:42:07.215 --> 00:42:08.475
That's, And that's,

913
00:42:08.475 --> 00:42:10.155
that's usually one hour live like this,

914
00:42:10.255 --> 00:42:12.955
and then the other four that's asynchronous, you know?

915
00:42:13.585 --> 00:42:16.315
Okay. Um, because like you should be able

916
00:42:16.315 --> 00:42:19.515
to do whatever and we can communicate ex, you know,

917
00:42:19.515 --> 00:42:21.155
through like the, the channel and also,

918
00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:24.275
and we have like, we use, um, Asana for like kind

919
00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.635
of task management and whatnot too.

920
00:42:26.415 --> 00:42:31.135
So, um, what so Haven I would do is like,

921
00:42:31.475 --> 00:42:35.895
you know, uh, we always review each person understand kind

922
00:42:35.895 --> 00:42:38.935
of where they fit in, what the long-term kind

923
00:42:38.935 --> 00:42:41.295
of plan looks like, because, you know, people aren't, yes,

924
00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:43.815
there's like a period in the beginning where we're getting

925
00:42:43.815 --> 00:42:45.535
to know each little bit more, but people stay in this

926
00:42:45.535 --> 00:42:47.935
for like their, for a long time.

927
00:42:48.075 --> 00:42:49.215
You know, the purpose isn't

928
00:42:49.215 --> 00:42:51.695
to do like a temporary relationship.

929
00:42:51.725 --> 00:42:53.455
It's supposed to be long term and people go in

930
00:42:53.455 --> 00:42:55.135
and out, you know, they get busier, they,

931
00:42:55.285 --> 00:42:56.775
they pull back, things like that.

932
00:42:56.795 --> 00:42:59.335
But, you know, people stay involved, uh, at some point

933
00:42:59.335 --> 00:43:00.695
or responsive at some point.

934
00:43:01.005 --> 00:43:03.095
Someone needs something at some point, someone wants

935
00:43:03.095 --> 00:43:04.575
to contribute at some point, things like that.

936
00:43:04.675 --> 00:43:05.695
So we'll go over that

937
00:43:05.715 --> 00:43:07.695
and what that kind of plan might look like for you.

938
00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:11.055
But if you have any questions, love you to know.

939
00:43:11.395 --> 00:43:12.855
But I appreciate you taking the time

940
00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:13.735
to go over things with me

941
00:43:13.735 --> 00:43:14.735
today. It's very nice meeting you.

942
00:43:15.445 --> 00:43:18.775
Sure, likewise. Um, any questions?

943
00:43:19.535 --> 00:43:20.895
I guess it's a bit specific.

944
00:43:21.155 --> 00:43:25.795
Um, as I am looking for employment, um, if there's a like,

945
00:43:26.055 --> 00:43:29.875
um, so Hebe said that there's like a hotspot in Dallas,

946
00:43:30.885 --> 00:43:32.705
and this is kind of the prime reason why I

947
00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:33.945
reached out to y'all.

948
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:38.525
Because to me, I haven't seen the glory of Dallas, uh,

949
00:43:38.525 --> 00:43:41.245
but I've been told this is one of the best cities to be in.

950
00:43:41.505 --> 00:43:43.205
And it's like, I look on my own eyes

951
00:43:43.205 --> 00:43:46.685
and I don't see where I could use Dallas to my vantage.

952
00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:50.375
So I'm wondering if I know Sahe is gonna watch this,

953
00:43:50.515 --> 00:43:54.425
if like, I could see the companies here

954
00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:55.705
that would be willing to work

955
00:43:55.765 --> 00:43:58.825
or, uh, hire an individual like me, um,

956
00:43:59.325 --> 00:44:01.985
or individuals in other states, which is another benefit,

957
00:44:02.525 --> 00:44:05.065
but I'm very comfortable working remotely.

958
00:44:05.405 --> 00:44:09.785
So I guess seeing what there is to kind of

959
00:44:10.725 --> 00:44:13.055
enhance my vision, I guess, um,

960
00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:15.055
of the Dallas hopefully make connections,

961
00:44:15.055 --> 00:44:16.255
which I know you said we'd get

962
00:44:16.255 --> 00:44:18.455
to in the future in Shaah, but Yeah.

963
00:44:18.595 --> 00:44:21.175
Um, yeah, I guess about the Dallas scape

964
00:44:21.355 --> 00:44:24.215
and any particular openings to myself.

965
00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:28.455
Yeah. Yeah.

966
00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:33.125
He'll, I mean, I know certain people that are in Dallas, uh,

967
00:44:33.435 --> 00:44:34.805
he's gonna have a much better idea.

968
00:44:35.425 --> 00:44:38.235
Um, but um,

969
00:44:40.575 --> 00:44:44.645
where I'm sure he will, uh, identify a few specific people,

970
00:44:45.345 --> 00:44:49.045
um, and places, uh, what we do, so what I'm doing this

971
00:44:49.045 --> 00:44:52.165
with a couple other people right now too, is that, um,

972
00:44:53.885 --> 00:44:56.095
once we've kind of identified who

973
00:44:56.115 --> 00:45:00.165
and where we, like,

974
00:45:00.185 --> 00:45:01.565
you can apply anywhere, right?

975
00:45:01.585 --> 00:45:04.645
You don't necessarily need us to apply to places.

976
00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:08.245
Uh, we try to specialize in the area

977
00:45:08.265 --> 00:45:11.165
of having those first good degree connections with,

978
00:45:11.315 --> 00:45:13.365
typically with people that are in medicine, for example,

979
00:45:13.645 --> 00:45:16.245
historically, like program directors and whatnot, right?

980
00:45:16.265 --> 00:45:19.725
But, you know, in other places too, it's like, uh, a lot

981
00:45:19.725 --> 00:45:22.525
of people that are in the network are like the co-founder

982
00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:23.725
or they are the CEO

983
00:45:23.725 --> 00:45:26.925
or they are the, the, you know, they manage the teams that,

984
00:45:27.105 --> 00:45:28.605
you know, certain people looking to be on.

985
00:45:29.105 --> 00:45:32.725
And we look to create that relationship

986
00:45:34.155 --> 00:45:38.205
with you, uh, to them so

987
00:45:38.205 --> 00:45:40.645
that they tend to either create a position

988
00:45:40.745 --> 00:45:43.045
or, you know, then they're in a position of like, oh, okay,

989
00:45:43.095 --> 00:45:44.165
let's, let's make something happen.

990
00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:47.605
And these are people that like we already know

991
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:50.525
I know firsthand or say, Hey, those firsthand.

992
00:45:50.985 --> 00:45:55.965
Um, and we, they're, they're high value, high,

993
00:45:56.025 --> 00:45:57.925
you know, low, they don't have a lot of time,

994
00:45:58.265 --> 00:46:00.485
but they're, uh, high value individuals that

995
00:46:01.065 --> 00:46:03.325
before we even get to the point of introducing your name,

996
00:46:03.785 --> 00:46:07.565
we want to know the scope of what you, uh, can do

997
00:46:07.565 --> 00:46:09.565
and, you know, make sure Yeah, yeah.

998
00:46:09.565 --> 00:46:12.745
Exactly. And obviously like everyone that comes

999
00:46:12.745 --> 00:46:16.415
through Green Medical is doing something right.

1000
00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:21.345
Everyone is driven, everyone is, um, uh,

1001
00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:24.425
you know, looking to achieve a goal

1002
00:46:24.565 --> 00:46:26.345
or continue along their

1003
00:46:26.995 --> 00:46:29.045
pathway career-wise and otherwise too.

1004
00:46:30.015 --> 00:46:34.915
So, um, it's not, it's, it's never a question

1005
00:46:35.095 --> 00:46:38.635
of, uh, integrity, uh, to go over things like that

1006
00:46:38.635 --> 00:46:40.275
before introducing people specifically.

1007
00:46:40.275 --> 00:46:42.555
It's, it is just knowing that when we're introducing people,

1008
00:46:43.215 --> 00:46:46.645
uh, we're behind you, right?

1009
00:46:46.665 --> 00:46:49.085
We wanna put you in a position that you're gonna be a,

1010
00:46:49.165 --> 00:46:51.045
a good candidate with them as well.

1011
00:46:51.065 --> 00:46:53.325
And so that, that's a lot of what I do is like,

1012
00:46:53.325 --> 00:46:54.405
work with people individually.

1013
00:46:55.035 --> 00:46:59.005
Like I'll give very specific feedback, um,

1014
00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:03.225
to people about, like here, um,

1015
00:47:04.005 --> 00:47:07.195
it would be like observing sometimes even in like a meeting

1016
00:47:07.255 --> 00:47:08.395
or like an innovation hour.

1017
00:47:08.465 --> 00:47:10.635
Like, you know, we, if someone's invited to that,

1018
00:47:11.425 --> 00:47:12.755
it's not open to everyone.

1019
00:47:12.775 --> 00:47:14.915
You either have to be invited specifically

1020
00:47:14.915 --> 00:47:15.995
or you're paying to be there.

1021
00:47:16.815 --> 00:47:20.075
And I wanna see the inter interaction engagement, um,

1022
00:47:21.165 --> 00:47:23.665
and like a, you know, you typically, those are recorded

1023
00:47:23.765 --> 00:47:25.185
and then I'll look at them

1024
00:47:25.185 --> 00:47:27.545
and I, I look more specifically at like, the engagement.

1025
00:47:28.105 --> 00:47:32.445
I look at like, do you see, do you,

1026
00:47:32.445 --> 00:47:33.605
are you coming across as someone

1027
00:47:33.605 --> 00:47:35.365
that actually cares about something?

1028
00:47:35.365 --> 00:47:36.605
Are you coming across as someone

1029
00:47:36.835 --> 00:47:38.245
that this person might wanna work with?

1030
00:47:38.245 --> 00:47:41.885
Because a lot of this stuff is just personalities, right?

1031
00:47:42.535 --> 00:47:45.065
Okay. And that's where I kind of come in is

1032
00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:48.775
because I'm not in medicine, I'm not in tech, you know, most

1033
00:47:48.795 --> 00:47:53.735
of my experience is in, you know, the advising or recruiting

1034
00:47:54.155 --> 00:47:57.455
or, um, in sales and things like that.

1035
00:47:57.795 --> 00:48:00.295
And so, uh, I care more about that part

1036
00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:02.255
and that's kind of where I come in as opposed to, so, hey,

1037
00:48:02.255 --> 00:48:04.495
it was a physician and you who's, you know,

1038
00:48:04.565 --> 00:48:07.375
more learned in computer science and, and other folks do.

1039
00:48:07.515 --> 00:48:10.135
So it's, it's seeing where they all kind of come together.

1040
00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:14.375
So that's that, um, you know, we'll,

1041
00:48:14.375 --> 00:48:17.335
we'll be active like in WhatsApp just to keep up

1042
00:48:17.335 --> 00:48:19.455
with what's going on, but we'll put together some sort

1043
00:48:19.455 --> 00:48:22.205
of like plan with the objective

1044
00:48:22.205 --> 00:48:23.565
of like, you know, you want to get a job.

1045
00:48:23.865 --> 00:48:26.925
That's kind of the current goal, right? Mm-Hmm.

1046
00:48:27.105 --> 00:48:28.765
And seeing what it takes to kinda get to that point.

1047
00:48:28.945 --> 00:48:31.445
So, um, he he'll review this. Yeah.

1048
00:48:31.515 --> 00:48:33.205
Yeah, he's on call, but he'll be off.

1049
00:48:33.465 --> 00:48:36.325
Um, and uh, if you have any questions, let me know,

1050
00:48:36.345 --> 00:48:38.085
but this is kind of it for this part of this.

1051
00:48:38.425 --> 00:48:40.845
Um, cool.

1052
00:48:41.395 --> 00:48:42.845
Yeah, sounds good, Salva.

1053
00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:44.405
Well, very nice meeting you,

1054
00:48:44.465 --> 00:48:46.125
so I appreciate taking the time.

1055
00:48:46.425 --> 00:48:49.045
Um, I was going to come to Dallas this coming week,

1056
00:48:49.065 --> 00:48:52.325
but my parents actually think they're sick with Covid, so

1057
00:48:53.315 --> 00:48:54.645
they, uh, didn't want me

1058
00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.365
or anyone to come down, so I might actually just end up

1059
00:48:57.365 --> 00:49:00.245
going to New Jersey, so we'll see.

1060
00:49:00.625 --> 00:49:02.605
